      |As this is an AP course there are hard due dates for student work and we won't be using a typical pacing guide. 
      |Instead, students are asked to use the

      |everyone to be on the same schedule. This will ensure students complete all of the course content 
      |by week 16 of the second term. While I am serious about the deadlines I recognize some students will 
      |start later so I will be a little flexible at the beginning of the semester
